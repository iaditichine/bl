<h2>Leafy Vegetables</h2>

<div>
<p>
<img style="float:right;" src="leafy.jpg">Leafy green vegetables are an essential part of a healthy diet as they are rich in vitamin C, antioxidants, fibre, calcium, folate and high in protein per calorie. Eating a diet rich in leafy vegetables can offer many benefits including reduced risk of obesity, heart disease and high blood pressure.
</p>
<h4><strong><u>Health Benefits of Leafy Vegatables:</u></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><em><u>Weight management</u></em>: Most green vegetables are low in calories. You can eat as much as you like without putting on extra weight.</li>
<br>
<li><em><u>Mortality rate</u></em>: Frequent consumption can substantially lower your mortality risk. Leafy greens contain vitamin K, Magnesium, the B vitamins, Calcium, amongst many other essential nutrients. These nutrients are critical for every cell function and hence, prevent the aging process and help us look youthful.</li>
<br>
<li><em><u>Cardiovascular disease</u></em>: Greens are low in fat, high in dietary fiber, and rich in folic acid, potassium, magnesium, vitamin C, and phytochemicals. One extra serving per day can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease by 11%.</li>
<br>
<li><em><u>Type 2 diabetes</u></em>: The high level of magnesium and low glycemic index that can be found in greens is ideal for preventing and treating diabetes. Studies showed that if you increase your intake of greens by just one serving per day, your risk of diabetes is lowered by 9%</li>
<br>
<li><em><u>Bone health</u></em>: The high levels of vitamin K, Magnesium, and calcium in leafy greens produces osteocalcin, the bone builders. Middle-aged women who eat over one serving of greens per day will lower their risk of a hip fracture by 45%.</li>
<br>
<li><em><u>Immune function</u></em>: The rich beta-carotene and Vitamin A improve the immune system.</li>
<br>

Carotenoids (lutein and zeaxanthin) found in leafy greens are concentrated in the macular region of the retina and the lenses of the eye. A diet dominant in leafy greens protects the eyes from needing eye glasses in kids to macular degeneration and cataracts in adults.</li>

<h2><strong>Myths About Food and Nutrition</strong></h2>
<img src='food-myth.jpg' style='width:380px;height:300px;'>
<ol>
    <li><strong>If you have diabetes, stay away from sugar and you’ll be fine</strong>
        <ul><li><strong><u>The truth</u></strong>: “All foods have different effects on blood sugar levels,” says nutritionist Robyn Webb. “While sugar is nutritionally devoid, it’s the total number of carbohydrates that may play a role in blood sugar management. So it’s important to monitor blood sugar even after eating whole foods such as fruit, vegetables, and whole grains.”</li></ul>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Fat makes you fat.</strong>
    <ul><li><strong><u>The truth</u></strong>: Fat gets such a bad rap that we often forget there are such things as healthy fats, such as those found in nuts, olive oil, salmon, and avocados, says Nicole Ferring Holovach. Yes, fat grams do contain more calories than carbs or proteins, but fat is still an essential component of our diet. Adds Elise Museles: They “keep you satiated by slowing down the digestion process so you stay full for a longer period of time.”</li></ul>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Eating more protein will lead to bigger muscles.</strong>
    <ul><li><strong><u>The truth</u></strong>: “A myth perpetuated in gyms!” Webb says. “While eating protein is important, eating more than you need is unnecessary. Resistance training and exercises in which you use your body weight as resistance, such as yoga, can lead to a more defined look. But eating a ton a protein is not going to lead to large muscular development.”</li></ul>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Muscle weighs more than fat.</strong>
    <ul><li><strong><u>The truth</u></strong>: “Unless the laws of physics have changed, one pound is one pound is one pound,” says Elana Natker. “The difference is that muscle is denser than fat, so one pound of muscle takes up less space than a pound of fat.”</li></ul>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Egg yolks are bad for you.</strong>
    <ul><li><strong><u>The truth</u></strong>: Don’t waste those yolks anymore—they’re a “goldmine of nutrition,” says Holovach. One yolk contains half of your day’s requirement of choline, which is an essential nutrient for the brain. Plus recent research shows that dietary cholesterol doesn’t affect blood cholesterol levels as much as previously thought, Holovach adds. Eggs for breakfast will fill you up with protein and fat and will keep you from overeating the rest of the day.</li></ul>
